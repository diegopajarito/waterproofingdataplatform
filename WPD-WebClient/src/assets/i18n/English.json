		"ABOUT_CONTENT_P1": "The project <a href='https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/waterproofing.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>“Waterproofing Data”  </a>investigates the governance of water-related risks, with a focus on social and cultural aspects of data practices. Typically, data flows up from local levels to scientific “centres of expertise”, and then flood-related alerts and interventions flow back down through local governments and into communities. Rethinking how flood-related data is produced, and how it flows, can help build sustainable, flood resilient communities.",
		"ABOUT_CONTENT_P2": "To this end, this project develops three innovative methods around data practices, across different sites and scales:",
		"ABOUT_CONTENT_P3": "These methodological interventions will transform how flood-related data is produced and flows, creating new governance arrangements between citizens, governments and flood experts and, ultimately, increased community resilience related to floods in vulnerable communities of Sao Paulo and Acre, Brazil.",
		"ABOUT_CONTENT_P4": "The project will be conducted by an international team of researchers with multiple disciplinary backgrounds from Brazil, Germany and the UK, in close partnership with researchers, stakeholders and publics of a multi-site case study on flood risk management in Brazil. Furthermore, the methods and results of this case study will be the basis for a transcultural dialogue with government organisations and local administration involved in flood risk management in Germany (<a href='https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/index_en.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>GIScience Heidelberg</a>) and the United Kingdom (<a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/research/waterproofing-data/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>University of Warwick</a>).",
